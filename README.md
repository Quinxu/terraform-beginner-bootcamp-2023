### Week 0
<details>
<summary>Detailed Work</summary>

#### Semantic Versioning

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging. [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format is in **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

For example, `1.0.1`

#### Install the Terraform CLI
##### Find Linux distribution
```
gitpod /workspace/terraform-beginner-bootcamp-2023 (2-refactor-terraform-cli) $ cat /etc/*-release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=22.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=jammy
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
```
##### Located the Installation commands 
Located the commands based on Linux distribution from the following documentation
[Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

##### Put the Commands in the Bash Script
Put the commands in /bin/install_terraform_cli bash script file and used it in gitpod.yml.

##### Changed the Bash File Permission

##### Run the Bash File in gitpod.yml


#### Updated The Task Execution Order in gitpod.yml
Changed from init to before to deal with the case of a workspace restart.
https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks


#### Work with Env Vars
##### env command
To list all env vars, 'env'

To filter it by xxx, 'env | grep xxx'

##### setting and unsetting Env Vars
To set an env var, `export varname=xxx`

To unset an env var, `unset varname`

To set env var inline when running a command
```
varname=xxx, ./bin/script
```

To set env var in a script
```
varname=xxx
echo $varname
```

##### Scope of Env Vars
It only exists in the created terminal. 

If it needs to be accessed across all terminals, it needs to be created in the bash profile - .bash_profile

##### Persist Env Vars in Gitpod
```
gp env varname=xxx
```
All future workspaces launched will have the set env var for all terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set env vars for unsensitive value in ./gitpod.yml.

Set sensitive env var in .env file, and put the file in gitignore to keep the values locally.

#### AWS CLI Installation

The bash script (./bin/install_aws_cli) is created to install AWS CLI for this project based on the [Install or update the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

We can check if our AWS credentials is configured correctly by running the following AWS CLI command:
```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Set env vars based on [Env var to configure the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

If the env var are set correctly according to AWS IAM Users' setting, the command should return the following json code:
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDAUAHNXGL7GECYBBCXX",
    "Account": "278376000000",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::278376000000:user/terraform-beginner"
}
``` 

#### Terraform Basics
For more information, please refer to [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)

##### Terraform
It uses Infrastructure as Code to provision and manage any cloud, infrastructure, or service such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more.

##### Terraform Registry
It makes easy to use any provider or module. To use a provider or module from The Terraform Registry, just add it to your configuration; when you run `terraform init`, Terraform will automatically download everything it needs.

##### Terraform Providers
They are the plugins that Terraform uses to manage those resources. Every supported service or infrastructure platform has a provider that defines which resources are available and performs API calls to manage those resources.

##### Terraform Modules
They are reusable Terraform configurations that can be called and configured by other configurations. Most modules manage a few closely related resources from a single provider.

##### Terraform Main Commands
  - init      
    Prepare your working directory for other commands
  - validate  
    Check whether the configuration is valid
  - plan      
    Show changes required by the current configuration
  - apply     
    Create or update infrastructure.
    - `terraform apply --auto-approve`
  - destroy   
    Destroy previously-created infrastructure

To see more commands, run `terraform`

##### Terraform Lock Files
 Currently, the Terraform only remembers the Terraform Provider dependency version chosen within the configuration lock file `.terraform.lock.hcl`

 It is recommended that the lock file be included in version control repositories with the rest of the Terraform (.tf) files for the project.

 When `terraform init` command is run, it will automatically create the Terraform Lock File if it doesnâ€™t exist. If the file already exists, then Terraform will update it with the latest dependency versions selected.

 If need to force the selected dependency versions to be updated, the -upgrade attribute flag can be added to the terraform init command, `terraform init -upgrade`



##### Terraform State Files
`Terraform.tfstate` is a file that Terraform uses to track the state of the infrastructure it manages. The state file contains information about the resources that Terraform has created or is managing, such as the resource type, attributes, and relationships. Terraform uses the state file to determine which changes to make to your infrastructure when you run terraform apply.

One should not edit the terraform.tfstate file directly, as this can cause Terraform to become confused about the state of your infrastructure. If you need to modify the state file, you can use the terraform state command.

The `terraform.tfstate.backup` file is a backup of the terraform.tfstate file. Terraform automatically creates a backup of the state file before making any changes to the state file. This ensures that you can recover from a corrupted or lost state file.

The terraform.tfstate.backup file is stored in the same directory as the terraform.tfstate file. It is overwritten every time Terraform makes changes to the state file.

You can use the terraform.tfstate.backup file to restore your Terraform state to a previous version. To do this, simply rename the terraform.tfstate.backup file to terraform.tfstate and run terraform init.

The both files shouldn't be committed to VCS.

##### Terraform Directory
Terraform uses configuration content from `.terraform`, and also uses the directory to store settings, cached plugins and modules, and sometimes state data.

#### Terraform Cloud
- After signing in the registered account at [terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/session), select to create the blank workspace of a organziation.
- Create the new project - terraform-beginner-bootcamp-2023
- When attempted to run `terraform login` from terminal, it didn't open browser properly to generate a token. The workaround is manually generate a token in [Terraform cloud](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login), copied the token string into /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json 
```
{
    "credentials": {
      "app.terraform.io": {
        "token": "xxxxx"
      }
    }
}
```
#### Terraform Login Workaround in Gitpod
Created the bash script [generate_tfrc_credentials](./bin/generate_tfrc_credentials) to use env var TERRAFORM_CLOUD_TOKEN to generate /home/gitpod/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json

### Week 1

<summary> Detailed Work </summary>

#### Run HTML Locally
- To install http server, run `npm install http-server` in aws-cli terminal
- To upload the file to S3 bucket, run `aws s3 cp public/index.html s3://qinxu/index.html`

#### Root Module Structure
Based on [Standard Module Structure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure),
our root module structure is as follows:
```
- Project_Root
  |- main.tf             (everything else)
  |- variables.tf        (stores the structure of input variables)
  |- terraform.tfvars    (the data of variables we want to load into our Terraform project)
  |- providers.tf        (defines required providers and their configurations)
  |- outputs.tf          (stores our outputs)
  |- README.md           (required for root modules)

```

#### Terraform and Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

##### Terraform Cloud Variables
In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Environment Variables
  - Those you would set in your bash terminal, like AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables
  - Those you would normally set in your tfvars file

  We can set Terraform Cloud varaibles to be sensitive so they are not shown visibly in the UI.

##### Loading Terraform Variables
- We can enter value at command prompted 
- or use '-var' flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file, eg. ```terraform plan -var user_uuid="my-user-id"``` 
- or use '-var-file' flag to set the variables from the file, eg. ```terraform plan -var-file=variables.tfvars```

- terraform.tvfars
  - This is the default file to load in blunk

- auto.tfvars
  - In Terraform, auto.tfvars is a special filename used to automatically load variable values. When Terraform initializes a configuration, it looks for this file in the working directory and loads any variable values defined within it. The use of auto.tfvars can help streamline the process of specifying variable values for your Terraform configuration.

    Here's how auto.tfvars works:

    Terraform looks for a file named auto.tfvars in the same directory where your Terraform configuration files (typically with a .tf extension) are located.

    Any variables defined in the auto.tfvars file are automatically loaded and assigned their values.

    You don't need to specify the -var-file option or provide variable values interactively; Terraform will automatically load the values from auto.tfvars.

    Variable values defined in auto.tfvars take precedence over the values defined in other variable files, like variables.tfvars or those provided through command-line flags. This means that if a variable is defined in both auto.tfvars and another variable file, the value from auto.tfvars will be used.

#### Dealing with Configuration Drift
- What happens if we lose our state file?
  - If statefile is missing, most likely all cloud infrastructure has to be torn down manually.
  - Terraform import can be used, but it won't for all cloud resources. Need to check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.
- Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import
  - [Terraform Input](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import)
  - [AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import), ```terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name```

- Fix Manual Configuration
  - If cloud resource is deleted or modified through manually clickOps, if we run ```terraform plan```, which attemps to put our infrastructure back into the expected state fixing configuration drift.

- Fix Using Terraform Refresh
  The terraform refresh command reads the current settings from all managed remote objects and updates the Terraform state to match.
  ```
  terraform apply -refresh-only
  ```

#### Terraform Modules
- Terraform Module Structure
  Modules are the main way to package and reuse resource configurations with Terraform.
  - Root Module
    Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the main working directory.
    - Child Module
      A Terraform module (usually the root module of a configuration) can call other modules to include their resources into the configuration. A module that has been called by another module is often referred to as a child module.
- Passing Input Variables
  we pass inptu variables in our module, eg.
  - ```
  module "terrahouse_aws"{
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name

}
  ```
- Module Sources
  [Module Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources)
  Using the source we can import the module from various places.

#### Considerations when using ChatGPT to write Terraform

LLMs such as ChatGPT may not be trained on the latest documentaton or information about Terraform.
It may likely produce older examples that could be deprecated. Often affecting providers.

#### Working with files in Terraform

- Path Variable
  In terraform there is a special variable called 'path' that allows us to reference local paths:
  - path.module -> is the filesystem path of the module where the expression is placed.
  - path.root -> is the filesystem path of the root module of the configuration.


  resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_bucket.bucket
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "${path.root}/public/index.html"
  etag = filemd5("${path.root}/public/index.html")
}

- Functions
  - fileexists -> determines whether a file exists at a given path.
      ```hcl
        variable "error_html_file_path" {
      type        = string
      description = "Path to the error.html file"

      validation {
        condition     = fileexists(var.error_html_file_path)
        error_message = "The specified error.html file does not exist."
      }
    }
  
  - filemd5 -> a variant of md5 that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.
    ```
    etag = filemd5("${path.root}/public/index.html")
    ```
[Special path variable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references)

#### Fixing Tags

[How to Delete Local and Remote Tags on Git](https://devconnected.com/how-to-delete-local-and-remote-tags-on-git/)

Locall delete a tag
```sh
git tag -d <tag_name>
```

Remotely delete tag

```sh
git push --delete origin tagname
```

Checkout the commit that you want to retag. Grab the sha from your Github history.

```sh
git checkout <SHA>
git tag M.M.P
git push --tags
git checkout main
```

#### Terraform Data Sources
[Data Soources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)
Data sources allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform
```
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {
  
}
```

#### Terraform Locals
[Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals)
A local value assigns a name to an expression, so you can use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression.
Once a local value is declared, you can reference it in expressions as local.<NAME>.
```
locals {
  s3_origin_id = "My-S3-Origin"
}

resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "s3_distribution" {
  origin {
    domain_name              = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_bucket.bucket_regional_domain_name
    origin_access_control_id = aws_cloudfront_origin_access_control.default.id
    origin_id                = local.s3_origin_id
  }
```

#### Working with JSON
[jsonencode Function](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode) encodes a given value to a string using JSON syntax.

we use the jsonencode to create the json policy inline in the hcl.

```tf
> jsonencode({"hello"="world"})
{"hello":"world"}

```

#### Changing the lifecycle of Resource
[Meta Arguments Lifecycle](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)


#### The terraform_data Managed Resource Type
[terraform_data](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data)
The terraform_data implements the standard resource lifecycle, but does not directly take any other actions. You can use the terraform_data resource without requiring or configuring a provider. It is always available through a built-in provider with the source address terraform.io/builtin/terraform.

The terraform_data resource is useful for storing values which need to follow a manage resource lifecycle, and for triggering provisioners when there is no other logical managed resource in which to place them.

```tf
variable "revision" {
  default = 1
}

resource "terraform_data" "replacement" {
  input = var.revision
}

# This resource has no convenient attribute which forces replacement,
# but can now be replaced by any change to the revision variable value.
resource "example_database" "test" {
  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [terraform_data.replacement]
  }
}

```
#### Provisioners
[Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)

Provisioners allow you to execute comands ton compute instances eg. a AWS CLI command.

They are not recommended for use by Hashicorp because Configuraton Management tools such as Ansible are a better fit, but the functionality exists.

- Local-exec
  invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource. 
  ```tf
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
  }
}

  ```

- Remote-exec
  invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc.
  ```tf
  resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Establishes connection to be used by all
  # generic remote provisioners (i.e. file/remote-exec)
  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}

  ```


#### For Each Meta-Argument
[For_each](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each)

to manage several similar objects (like a fixed pool of compute instances) without writing a separate block for each one.

If a resource or module block includes a for_each argument whose value is a map or a set of strings, Terraform creates one instance for each member of that map or set.

```
resource "aws_iam_user" "the-accounts" {
  for_each = toset( ["Todd", "James", "Alice", "Dottie"] )
  name     = each.key
}

```
